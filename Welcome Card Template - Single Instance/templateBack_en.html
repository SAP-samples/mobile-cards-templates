            The back of the card shows additional content (if available). For some cards, there is the ability to set a 'reminder' on a card which will trigger a notification on the device at the time(s) you set, enabling you to open the card again quickly.

                SAP Mobile Cards integrates with Spotlight Search on the device (provided this has not been disabled by your Administrator). As new cards arrive, they will be indexed and become searchable using Spotlight search.

                To find all cards which relate to addresses close to your current location, or have time-based attributes that are due to take place soon, use the 'shake' gesture on the device. To do this, open the SAP Mobile Cards app, and shake the phone. Any cards that fall into these categories will automatically be displayed in the search results.
